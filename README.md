(Note: This is a WIP)
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Nice to have you here!
I'm a passionate Web-Developer with some years of experience in working with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I also already worked with React, SASS and SQLite among other technologies.

### What i am currently doing ðŸ”­
Currently i am enrolled in the SE course at Masterschool to put my knowledge to the next level.
This includes insight into Backend Development to become a reliable Full-Stack-Developer.
Also learning to include (but not totally relying on) AI technologies in my projects is my duty there.
Learning never stops, and i am always happy to see whats ahead!
